# Simple glyphs test data ascii file format
# Single line comments (like this one) are allowed
# Blank lines are allowed

# Each glyph goes on one line; the following formats are allowable

# 1.) two positions (note that this simple program sets the radius of all glyphs to 0.2)
# pos1 pos2
(1.0,0,0) (1.6,0.8,1)

# 2.) +color; _some_ glyph types honor this; colors are RGB [0..1]
# pos1 pos2 col
(0,0,0.6) (1.5,0,0.6) (0.9,0.3,0.1)

# 3.) +acceleration; motion blur glyphs will honor this
# pos1 pos2 col accel
(0,1.3,1) (3,1.3,1) (0.0,0.0,0.8) (100000,0,0)
